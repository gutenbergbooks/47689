<h3 class="no-break"><b>SPANISH WROUGHT-IRON SCREENS.</b></h3>






<p class="p2">From earliest times the numerous iron
mines which exist in Spain, especially
in the Cantabrian provinces,
have been worked, and their presence has
developed in that country excellent objects
of art in metal at all times; but owing to
the perishable character of iron, the slight
intrinsic value of the material, and the little
care taken of such fabrics, examples of
very early specimens, with the exception
of a few interesting ones which have reached
us from the Spanish Arabs, have disappeared.
The most interesting examples of
Moorish manufacture which have survived
are some iron keys of most delicate tracery.
Their perfect state of preservation shows
that they were used only as symbols of
cities or fortresses, and, on given occasions,
offered to kings or great people,
and even in the present day in Spain this
ceremony is kept up, and a key signifying
the freedom of the palace, is offered to the
foreign princes who stay at the royal residence
in Madrid. In a similar manner, as
far back as the middle ages, keys have been
presented to Spanish sovereigns on occasions
of their visits to such towns as Toledo
and Seville; and a ceremony of swearing
them to uphold the accorded privilege is
gone through with,&mdash;a reminiscence probably
of what occurred when these towns
were conquered from the Moors. One of
these keys at Valencia, belonging to Count
de Trignona, measures nine and-a-half
inches long, and was originally gilt. Its
handle is closed and covered with delicate
work in relief, and the wards are ornamented
in the same manner with a combination
of several words written in Cufic
letters of difficult interpretation; but
around the handle we can read distinctly
in arabic the name of the artist: "It was
made by Ahmel Ahsan." This key appears
to date from the thirteenth or early fourteenth
century, and two similar ones exist
in the Town Hall of Valencia.</p>

<p>Worthy objects of iron work must have
been made by Christian artists of this
period in Spain, for, although no specimens
have come down to us, we have historical
information which confirms such a
conclusion. In the ordinances of Barcelona
we find it recorded that the iron-smiths
formed an extensive guild in the
thirteenth century, and that in 1257 four
of its members were officers of the Chief
Municipal Council; and other similar records
substantiate the fact that this guild
increased in importance during the succeeding
centuries. The ordinances of
Seville of the fifteenth century, which were
reformed in 1502, and those of Toledo, also
revised in 1582, will give the student an
idea of what was done by workers of metals
at this period, the method of workmanship
and other interesting details. The ordinances
of Seville mention <i>rejas</i> made in
Biscay, and give a good idea of the styles
adopted by the iron-masters there, and the
ordinances of Granada repeat, almost exactly,
the former descriptions.</p>

<p>The modern history of iron work in Spain
begins, however, with the second half of the
fifteenth century. From this period on,
the art continued to progress, and in the
sixteenth century Spain produced works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>of art in wrought iron which
were unrivalled in Europe.</p>

<p>The most beautiful and characteristic
productions of the
Spanish iron-smiths were the
openwork screens or grilles,
especially the <i>rejas</i>, or chancel
screens, enclosing the chapels
in the cathedrals; and these
last deserve special attention,
from the beauty of their forms,
the quality of their workmanship
and the intrinsic variety
of their models.</p>

<p>The interior arrangement of
Spanish cathedrals differs
somewhat from that of
churches in other parts of
Europe. In Spain, the choir
proper, or <i>coro</i>, is transferred
to the nave, of which it commonly
occupies the western
half, and a passage, usually
protected by low iron or brass
railings, leads from the eastern
gate of the <i>coro</i> to the screen
in front of the high altar.
This arrangement is necessary
because, as the choir proper is
deep, the people must be kept
from pressing on the clergy as
they pass to and fro, during
the service, in the long passage
from the altar to the <i>coro</i>.
High metal screens or <i>rejas</i>
are also placed across the entrance
to the choir or "capilla mayor," as
its eastern part is called. Owing to this
form of interior arrangement the cathedrals
and churches of Spain lent themselves
admirably to the construction of
objects of all kinds in ornamental iron
work; and from the earliest times when
such records were kept, we meet with many
names of iron-masters who were apparently
attached to the different cathedrals
in the same manner as were the painters
and artists.</p>

<p>One of the finest specimens of this artistic
industry (and we place it first because
it is a typical example) is the splendid
<i>reja</i> which divides the nave from the
"Royal Chapel" in the Cathedral of Granada
(Plate <a href="#XIX">XIX</a>).</p>

<p>This Cathedral is, on the whole, the best
Renaissance building in Spain, and in plan
one of the finest churches in Europe; and
the "Royal Chapel" is the most interesting
feature of its interior. This Chapel
was erected in the late Gothic style, in
1506-17, for the reception of the tombs of
the "Catholic Kings," and was afterwards
enlarged by Charles V., who found it "too
small for so great glory." Besides the
tombs of Ferdinand and Isabella it contains
those of the parents of Charles V.</p>

<p>The <i>reja</i> which guards it was completed
about 1522, by the celebrated Bartolomé of
Jaen, who also worked at Seville, and
whom the records of the time describe as
"sculptor and iron-master." Its important
size enabled the artist to carry out
a splendid scheme of ornamentation in the
"plateresque" style, combined with reliefs,
on a large scale, of figures of apostles and
saints, terminating at the upper part with
a wide ornamental band of conventional
floral decoration in relief, crowned with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Crucifixion, with the Virgin and Saint John
on either side. The ornamentation was
originally gilded and the figures painted in
oil colors. The balustrades and supports
are forged with the hammer. The figures
and circular piers are formed of large
plates, <i>repoussé</i> and carved in a most
admirable manner, and an examination of
them will give a good idea of the technical
mastery over the material which the artists
of this time had attained long before the
various mechanical facilities of the present
day existed.</p>

<p>This <i>reja</i> at Granada is entirely of iron,
which most Spanish <i>rejas</i> are not, and is
the earliest specimen of anything like equal
importance in Spain. It has been chosen
as the first specimen to be here described,
not only because of the early date of its
construction, but because it excellently
illustrates the salient merits of the best
type of Spanish cathedral screen. The
first of these merits is a general transparency,&mdash;a
highly important quality in a
wrought-iron screen so placed, for if such
a screen be covered with sufficient ornament
to arrest the eye on its surface when
viewing the interior of the cathedral as a
whole, it detracts from the general architectural
effect, serving indeed, to block the
nave as a wall where no wall was intended.
In such a screen as the present one, however,
the slight vertical piers almost disappear
unless the sight be focussed upon
them, while the ornamental portions seem
apparently suspended in mid air and do not
in any way injure the general architectural
scheme or decrease the apparent space.
The rectangularity of the design gives
great repose; and the division into departments,
which allows of the concentration
of strength in skeleton lines, affords sufficient
constructional stiffness without involving
too much formality. The design
is both beautiful and appropriate. At the
summit the crucifixion, below the leading
incidents of biblical history, and, in a
central panel about twenty feet square,
grouped in a decorative design, the full
heraldic insignia of the monarchs who
repose in the tombs which the screen
guards. The lock bears a small inscription
giving the name of the artist, "Maestro
Bartolomé me fec."</p>

<p>To consider in detail the multitude of
similar rich and beautiful railings which
happily survive in Spanish cathedrals and
churches, would be impossible, even were it
possible to illustrate them; but, for the most
part, they have never been drawn or photographed,
and a brief description of those
illustrated in our plates must here suffice.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Seville is undoubtedly
one of the largest, handsomest and richest
Gothic churches in Christendom, and was
once a veritable museum of works of art.
An old saying groups the chief churches of
Spain together as "<i>Toledo la rica, Salamanca
la fuerte, Leon la bella, Oviedo la
sacra, e Sevilla la grande</i>." It originally
contained some very beautiful <i>rejas</i>, including
two famous ones by Sancho Muñoz;
but these with many other art treasures,
were destroyed by the twice falling of the
dome, first in 1511 and again in 1888, due
to earthquake shocks. The three chapel
screens shown in our illustrations (Plates
<a href="#XX">XX.</a>, <a href="#XXI">XXI.</a>, and <a href="#Page_41">page 41</a>) remain, however,
to show how rich in iron work this Cathedral
originally must have been. The
names of the artists of these screens are
not certainly known. The "Altar de la
Gamba," shown in Plate <a href="#XX">XX.</a>, derives its
curious name, "The Altar of the Leg,"
from the finely painted leg of Adam in the
picture which adorns the shrine, representing
our first parents adoring the Virgin.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Barcelona, one of the
noblest creations of Spanish Gothic, stands
upon the highest point of the ancient city,
on a site originally occupied by a Roman
temple and later by a Moorish mosque.
On the southwest the cathedral is adjoined
by magnificent Gothic cloisters, finished
in 1448. Along the northwest side of these
cloisters is a row of chapels, placed back
to back with the chapels of the southwest
aisle of the church. The entrances to these
chapels are closed by iron grilles of simple
but dignified design. One of them is
shown in our illustration (Plate <a href="#XXII">XXII.</a>).</p>

<p>Although the cathedral of Avila was
commenced in 1091 its general character is
that of the end of the twelfth or early part
of the thirteenth century, though the
solemn and dignified interior is designed
in a style of a later date. Besides the
beautiful <i>reja</i> here shown (Plate <a href="#XXIII">XXIII.</a>),
which divides the high altar from the
church proper, it contains a fine iron pulpit
(<a href="#Page_47">page 47.</a>)</p>

<p>Iron pulpits, so rare elsewhere, have
been made in Spain with great success.
The one here illustrated shows a mixture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>of Gothic and Renaissance detail, but the
whole is of contemporary workmanship,
and presents an interesting example of the
transitional style. The primitive method
of working through thin plates superimposed
to form tracery is here adhered to,
and the whole is applied to a wooden
framework. The pulpit was originally gilt.
It dates from the end of the fifteenth
century, and shows the influence of the
Flemish masters who at about that period
set so many fashions in Burgos and its
vicinity. The wrought-iron screen (shown
on <a href="#Page_47">page 47</a>), now preserved in the collection
of the Louvre, belongs to the same time,
and is of the same style of workmanship.</p>

<p>The interior of the cathedral of Burgos
is, from its lofty spacious proportions, one
of the finest in Spain, and is surrounded,
unsymmetrically but not unpicturesquely,
by fourteen chapels, all distinguished by
some particular beauty of construction or
ornamentation. The chief of these chapels,
situated at the east end of the cathedral, is
the gorgeous "Capilla del Condestable,"
built for Don Pedro Fernandez de Velasco,
hereditary Constable of Castile, in 1487.
This chapel contains superbly sculptured
tombs of the Constable and his wife, and the
lofty <i>reja</i> (Plate <a href="#XXVI">XXVI.</a>) which guards the
entrance to it has been considered one of
the finest specimens of its kind, owing to
the perfection with which every detail is
carried out. It is the master-piece of
Cristoval de Andino, and was constructed
in 1523. A contemporary writer describing
it says: "Good workmen, and those who
wish that their work may have authority
and be blameless, must endeavor to be
guided by ancient models, as was your
fellow citizen Cristoval de Andino; and
his works are thereby more elegant and
excellent than any others which I have
seen up to the present time. If you think
otherwise, judge of his work by looking at
the <i>reja</i> which he is making for your lord,
the Constable, which is undoubtedly superior
to all those that have hitherto been
made in Spain." The centre of the upper
part of the <i>reja</i> bears the signature of the
artist, "Ab. Andino, A.D. MDXXIII."</p>

<p>The famous University of Salamanca
was originally built in 1415, but in 1480 the
upper part was entirely reconstructed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>the most brilliant "plateresque"
style, by the "Catholic
Kings." The various offices
of the University are grouped
around a simple, cloister-like
court; and on the west side of
the second floor is the Library,
which contains 80,000 volumes,
and is said to have been
founded by Alfonso the
Learned in 1254. The entrance
to this Library is closed
by the beautiful wrought grille
shown in Plate <a href="#XXIV">XXIV.</a> The
exact date and the authorship
of the grille are unknown.</p>

<p>The Church of San Juan de
la Penitencia is a jumble of
curious styles. Built by the
Cardinal Ximenez in 1514, a
semi-Moorish palace was partially incorporated
with it, and it contains much interesting
Moorish decoration. The ceiling
of the nave and choir is Moorish, the
portal and choir windows are Gothic,
several of the altars are baroque, and the
elaborate <i>reja</i>, here reproduced (Plate
<a href="#XXV">XXV.</a>) is a fine specimen of "plateresque"
iron-work.</p>

<p>The old Cathedral of Saragossa is called
"La Seo," par excellence, to distinguish it
from the other called "del Pilar," "seo"
being the usual term for the principal
church. It was erected in 1119-1520 on the
site of the principal mosque of
the Moors, and the general
arrangement of the interior
resembles that of a mosque.
The sides are flanked with
chapels; and the Chapel of
Zaporta (Zaporta was a rich
citizen of the city who died
early in the sixteenth century)
is shut off by an iron screen,
of excellent workmanship in
the less elaborate "plateresque"
style, shown in the
small engraving on <a href="#Page_45">page 45</a>.</p>

<p>After the sixteenth century
smiths' work in Spain declined
in artistic interest and importance.
The abilities of the iron-workers
were devoted to constructing
objects on a smaller
scale, such as door locks, clock
ornaments and the like; the
arts of inlaying iron-work with
gold and silver sprung into
prominence, and Spanish
artists practically ceased to
undertake the great carved
and chiselled grilles which
have formed the subject of
this paper.</p>

<p>This splendid work of Norman-Sicilian
artists is Latin in its shape, Roman in its
colonnade, Byzantine in its mosaics, Greek
in its sculpture, Saracenic and Norman in
its many mouldings, exhibiting a most
curious combination of styles. The names
of the architects are unknown (the näive
Vasari attributes this to "their stupidity
or contempt of fame"), but the evidence
afforded by a careful examination of the
mosaics, establishes the conclusion that
King William intrusted the embellishment
to Greek, that is to say, Byzantine, artists
or to their Sicilian disciples. At any rate,
the artists who embellished Monreale in
the latter part of the twelfth and the beginning
of the thirteenth centuries were in
every way the equals in artistic abilities of
the Italian masters who lived and worked
a century later; and when we talk of the
Renaissance we should not forget that long
before its advent these Sicilian artists had
here produced work that today challenges
the wonder and admiration of critics.</p>

<p>"Other cathedrals," says Mr. Symonds,
"may surpass that of Monreale in sublimity,
bulk, strength or unity of plan. None
can surpass it in the strange romance with
which the memory of its many artificers
invests it. None can exceed it in the richness
and glory, the gorgeousness of a
thousand decorative elements."</p>

<p>Of the original buildings of the Benedictine
monastery which formed a part of
the church, and were built at the same
time, none but the cloister remains. This
cloister is in its kind one of the most superb
examples of twelfth century architecture
to be found in Europe, and is one of the
largest as well as one of the most beautiful
in the world. The cloisters of St. John
Lateran, St. Paul-beyond-the-Walls, Ste.
Scholastica, at Subiaco, are all admirable,
but they are inferior to that of Monreale,
both in detail and in grandeur of total
effect.</p>

<p>Imagine a vast central space, one hundred
and sixty-nine feet square,&mdash;not a flat
grass-plot scattered with decaying tombs,
nor planted with the severe box-wood and
funereal cypresses that give so gloomy an
aspect to most cloisters, but a blooming
garden, adorned with shrubs and flowering
vines, laid out in parterres of exquisite verdure,
where, in the shade of myrtle and
citron trees, fountains play, their jets
caught in marble basins, only to overflow
and nourish the living green about them.
This garden is walled in by four long corridors,
sheltered by arcades of small pointed
arches with something Oriental in their
curves, supported by two hundred and sixteen
coupled columns of white marble, with
a group of four at each angle, all of them
surmounted by carved capitals of different
designs, the slender shafts ornamented
with mosaics and incrusted with precious
marbles, some patterned in lozenges, some
curved with floral designs, some fluted
after the antique manner, some wound with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>capricious spirals,&mdash;a file of shining columns
of fairy-like aspect. And, looking at
this perennial garden with its ever-running
fountains, surrounded by so Oriental an
arcade, one might fancy one's self transported
to a monastic Alhambra, or the
interior of an Arabian-Night's palace.</p>

<p>The capitals of the shafts that uphold the
arcade (and from the slenderness of these
shafts it is probable that they were inserted
some time after the heavier arcade was
originally built), are all different. A
number of them are here illustrated. In
their design the sharp acanthus foliage of
the Greeks is commingled with the emblems
of Christianity, such as the circle, the cross,
the vine and the dove, with infinitely ingenious
grotesques of birds and animals,
and with human figures. The latter are
represented in Byzantine costume, and
Greek inscriptions everywhere appear.
The workmanship of these capitals, the
delicate detail of the carving, showing the
constant employment of the circular drill,
the almost entire concealment of the background,
are tokens of the craftsmanship
of the twelfth century Byzantine Greeks
Contemporary personages, scenes from the
old and new Testaments, real and fantastic
animals, leaves, flowers, fruit,&mdash;all are represented
with a wonderful liveliness of
expression and with prodigious fecundity
of imagination. They exhibit, as M. Dantier
has said: "<i>Toute la foi, toute la poésie du
temps sculptées sur la pierre.</i>"</p>
